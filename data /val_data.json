just like you did you should then use a backup method of birth control eg condoms for one week if you missed a pill from day 3 through 21 of your pack you should take the forgotten pill as soon as you remember it and the next at its usual time as above backup birth control is not required in this case if you missed one of the inactive pills the white ones you dont need to take the forgotten pill

year endometrial thickness is really only relevant in the context of couples trying to get pregnant through in vitro fertilization the thickness of your uterine lining is somewhat related to your estrogen levels when couples are undergoing ivf treating with additional estrogen can thicken the uterine lining however because youve been only trying to get pregnant for four months your endometrial lining may have absolutely nothing to do with the reason why you have not yet conceived furthermore unless your husbands sperm count has been shown to be decreased magazine should not have any effect on fertility nor should affect any health of a developing baby should you conceive medications taken during pregnancy by the mother can affect the fetus but not any medication taken by the father because medication cannot be transmitted before fertilization through sperm so unless the medication causes the sperm count to be low or abnormal there is no medical reason why your husband needs to

difficult to identify the trigger these triggers vary from child to child and can include viral infections such as the common coldexposure to air pollutants such as tobacco smokeallergies to dust

your treating doctor i will recommend cardiac echocardiography and the most important a holder rhythm monitoring for minimally 48 h this rises the possibility to catch any problem you must know that the rhythm monitoring is random it might happen that you do it but it doesnt happens anything with your rhythm during that day and so we dont catch anything so it is mandatory to take it as long as possible and repeat it according to the carotid result it doesnt explain the syncope so my opinion is to continue and do holder rhythm monitoring and if no result maybe a head ct scan hope i was

occasionally rhythm issues but to decide what is they cause and how to deal with it if i was the treating doctor i will recommend some examination like an electrocardiogram a full blood analyze to

principles firmly we inquire about the associated symptoms the child had with fever apart from that the extent and pattern of fever whether it was associated with chills or came at any particular time

for a stomach infection then for pneumonia and finally for urinary tract infection in such a situation you have two possibilities either he had 3 different kinds of infection which presented with fever over 2 months in which case his fever should have subsided each time with the medication he should have felt better and then again fallen sick with a new infection if that is not the case then his fever could probably be attributed to a single cause with the other two being misdiagnoses in such cases investigations could give support and clue as to what the exact cause of fever is mucosal irregularities in urinary bladder is a very nonspecific finding and the diagnosis of a urinary tract infection should never solely be based on that associated symptoms of pain or difficulty in

which is given for psychosis and fluoxetine 20 mg which is given for depression located is a medication given for sleep disturbance and anxiety though you have not mentioned the initial diagnosis made at the time of starting the medication i am presuming that she must have suffered from depressive and psychotic symptoms which must have been the reason she was put on that particular combination now you have mentioned that there were no side effects noticed so far with this medication it is therefore very unlikely that she is suddenly having side effects of located after being on that medication for about 10 months moreover 025 mg is a minimal dose and is unlikely to suddenly cause all these symptoms the symptoms which she is experiencing ie difficulty in concentrating lack of interest lethargy excessive sleep increased appetite etc may be depressive symptoms i would suspect that she may be having a relapse of her depression i think you should discuss this with your doctor so that he can assess her in detail to see if she is actually having a relapse of her previous symptoms furthermore i think it is okay to taper down the dose of located because sedative medication are usually advised only for short periods and can have an addictive potential nevertheless i strongly feel that she needs detailed assessment and further observation in order to be given the correct treatment
