after seemingly complete cure treatment of psoriasis is guided by the extent of involvement limited disease is best managed with just topical applications creams ointments gels lotions shampoos whereas extensive disease involving 20 body surface area is usually managed with systemic treatments in addition to topical applications psoriasis is steroid responsive as you have noticed in your case the disease gets better with topical steroids however it may recur sometimes as soon as you stop steroids one has to be very careful in using steroids because though steroids are effective in psoriasis one cannot use them forever because steroids can lead to side effects like skin atrophy if used over long term moreover steroids if stopped suddenly can lead to a rebound flare which may be of increased intensity as compared to previous episodestherefore while steroids are good for providing initial rapid improvement they should be substituted with alternatives like vitamin d analogues like calcitriol calcitriol once the initial rapid response is attained vitamin d analogues are devoid of the side effects of steroids and can also be used safely over long term moreover rebound flare is not an issue with vitamin d analogues since you have limited disease scalp involvement therefore topical would be adequate for you if i was the treating doctor i would have also added a coal tarsalicylic acid based shampoo to be used thrice weekly i would have asked you to use vitamin d analogues for scalp psoriasis rather than topical steroids you may ask more about these from your

what it is in your case a biopsy has already been done and let us await its result youre understanding that cancerous lumps dont bleed after biopsy is correct but i think your presumption that if it was scar tissue it would have bled is not correct scar tissue also need not bleed needle biopsies do not usually cause any bleeding unless a blood vessel is ruptured during the procedure since how long have you noticed this lump is the size of the lump increasing if the biopsy comes as positive for cancer then you will have to undergo a series of investigation to find out he the extent of the disease whether it is confined to the chest wall only or whether it has gone beyond the chest wall to other regions treatment decision will depend on the results of this if the biopsy comes as negative for cancer then there are 2 options 1 if your physician thinks it is insignificant then you need to follow it up just keep a check on your lump to see whether it is increasing in size and also get it checked by your physician regularly2 the second option and my preference is to do an open biopsy especially if the lump was detected recently and is increasing in size and also if the lump is firm to hard and not very soft the reason is needle biopsy can be negative but this does not always mean there is no cancer especially if the tissue sample taken is not adequate also time factor is

answer your question today i am sorry to hear about your diagnosis and i am happy to hear that your girlfriend is planning on getting vaccinated the reason why booster shots are given during vaccination is to create a subset of immune cells called memory b cells these cells store the memory of the antigen in this case hepatitis b virus and will produce protective antibodies as soon as they encounter it the next time for ex if your girlfriend by any chance gets infected the creation of memory b cells may require multiple exposures to the antigen hence the booster doses having said that this holds true to the majority of cases some people can develop high levels of protective antibodies even with minute exposure to antigens the only way to know for sure whether a protective level of antibodies have been attained is to measure the antibug antibody levels which is done routinely in most laboratories some people who are poor responders may need up to 56 booster shots before a protective level is reached so in short if you want to be sure of the immunity of your girlfriend i would measure her blood levels of protective antibodies 10 iu is considered protective this does not mean i am discouraging you from getting the booster doses the only way to be fully immune is to complete the vaccination schedule hope this helped and hope you get better please do not hesitate to

advised as mentioned in history the pain persisting in hip region and also the shin i feel it should be the disc herniation pain as the post healing symptoms are present still also i will advise to stop the aerobics for time being as aerobics is more of the high torque exercises which leads to gravity induced movements in the limbs by applying additional pressure on the muscles to make the spine more mobile in the unstable surface also you need to focus more in performing mat exercises currently till the muscles become stronger and the spine gets stabilized due to instability in the spine
